Two apples 
up on top! 


Look, you. 
I can do it, too. 


Look! 

See! 

I can do three! 


Three . . , 
Three . . . 

You can do three 
but I can do more. 
You have three 
but I have four. 

Look! See, now. 
I can hop 
with four apples 
up on top. 

And I can hop 
up on a tree 
with four apples 
up on me. 

See here, you two. 
I can get five 
on top. 

Can you? 

Seven apples 
up on top! 

Five, six, seven! 

Fun, fun, fun! 

Seven, six, five, 
four, three, two, one! 



Look! Now we 
have seven, too* 

Eight! Eight on top! 
Eight apples up! 

Not one will drop. 


But I can do nine. 
And hop! 

And drink! 

You can not do this, 
I think. 

We can! We can! 
We can do it, too. 

See here. 

We are as good as you! 

Nine is very good. 
But then . . . 
Come on and we 
will make it ten! 




Look! 


Ten 

apples 

up 

on 

top! 

We are not 

going to let them drop!
